# image_decomposition

## Description

This project explores the decomposition of superimposed images using deep learning techniques. It is an extension the image processing lecture taken at ENSEEIHT. The main goal of this project is to decompose the following image target.png. This photography is an undesired double exposure of two different scenes.

![Target](target.png)

The data used in this project comes from the PISC (People in Social Context) dataset which contains images of peoples in different scenes. Many research papers inspired this work such as the ones mentionned in [references](#references). A full report of my work, written in french, can be found in [superimposed_image_decomposition.pdf](superimposed_image_decomposition.pdf).

## Installation

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
